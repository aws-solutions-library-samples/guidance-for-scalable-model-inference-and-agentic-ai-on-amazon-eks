## Overview
This solution implements a comprehensive, scalable ML inference architecture using Amazon EKS, leveraging both Graviton processors for cost-effective CPU-based inference and GPU instances for accelerated inference. The system provides a complete end-to-end platform for deploying large language models with agentic AI capabilities, including RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) and intelligent document processing.

## ⚠️ Important Setup Instructions

**Before proceeding with this solution, ensure you have:**

1. **AWS CLI configured** with appropriate permissions for EKS, ECR, CloudFormation, and other AWS services
2. **kubectl installed** and configured to access your target AWS region
3. **Docker installed** and running (required for building and pushing container images)
4. **Sufficient AWS service quotas** - This solution requires multiple EC2 instances, EKS clusters, and other AWS resources
5. **Valid Hugging Face token** - Required for accessing models (see instructions below)
6. **Tavily API key** - Required for web search functionality in agentic applications

**Recommended Setup Verification:**
```bash
# Verify AWS CLI access
aws sts get-caller-identity

# Verify kubectl installation
kubectl version --client

# Verify Docker is running
docker ps

# Check available AWS regions and quotas
aws ec2 describe-regions
aws service-quotas get-service-quota --service-code ec2 --quota-code L-1216C47A
```

## Agentic Application Architecture
![Architecture Diagram](image/Inference_GenAI_app_architecture_EKS.jpg)

The architecture diagram illustrates our scalable ML inference solution with the following components:

1. **Amazon EKS Cluster**: The foundation of our architecture, providing a managed Kubernetes environment with automated provisioning and configuration.
   
2. **Karpenter Auto-scaling**: Dynamically provisions and scales compute resources based on workload demands across multiple node pools.
   
3. **Node Pools**:
   - **Graviton-based nodes (ARM64)**: Cost-effective CPU inference using m8g/c8g instances
   - **GPU-based nodes (x86_64)**: High-performance inference using NVIDIA GPU instances (g5, g6 families)
   - **x86-based nodes**: General purpose compute for compatibility requirements
   
4. **Model Hosting Services**:
   - **Ray Serve**: Distributed model serving with automatic scaling
   - **Standalone Services**: Direct model deployment for specific use cases
   - **Multi-modal Support**: Text, vision, and reasoning model capabilities
   
5. **Model Gateway**: 
   - **LiteLLM Proxy**: Unified OpenAI-compatible API gateway with load balancing and routing
   - **Ingress Controller**: External access management with SSL termination
   
6. **Agentic AI Applications**:
   - **RAG with OpenSearch**: Intelligent document retrieval and question answering
   - **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**: Automated document analysis and extraction
   - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinated AI workflows with specialized agents
   
7. **Observability & Monitoring**: 
   - **Langfuse**: LLM observability and performance tracking
   - **Prometheus & Grafana**: Infrastructure monitoring and alerting

This architecture provides flexibility to choose between cost-optimized CPU inference on Graviton processors or high-throughput GPU inference based on your specific requirements, all while maintaining elastic scalability through Kubernetes and Karpenter.

## Architecture Steps

1. **Foundation Setup**: The foundation begins with an Amazon EKS cluster, configured for application readiness and with compute plane managed by Karpenter. This setup efficiently provisions both AWS Graviton and GPU based instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring robust infrastructure distribution and high availability of various Kubernetes services.

2. **User Request Entry**: User interaction starts through HTTP requests directed to an exposed endpoint, managed by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). This entry point serves as the gateway for all user queries and ensures balanced distribution of incoming traffic while maintaining consistent accessibility.

3. **Orchestration and Analysis**: The orchestrator agent, powered by Strands Agent SDK, serves as the central coordination hub. It processes incoming queries by connecting with reasoning models supported by LiteLLM and vLLM services, analyzing the requests, and determining the appropriate workflow and tools needed for response generation. LiteLLM functions as a unified API gateway for model management, providing centralized security controls and standardized access to both embedding and reasoning models.

4. **Knowledge Validation**: Knowledge validation begins as the orchestrator agent delegates to the RAG agent to verify knowledge base currency. When updates are needed, the RAG agent initiates the process of embedding new information into the Amazon Opensearch cluster, ensuring the knowledge base remains current and comprehensive.

5. **Embedding Process**: The embedding process is handled within a KubeRay cluster, where the Ray header dynamically manages worker node scaling based on resource demands. These worker nodes execute the embedding process through the llamacpp framework, while the RAG agent simultaneously embeds user questions and searches for relevant information within the OpenSearch cluster.

6. **Quality Assurance**: Quality assurance is performed by the Evaluation Agent, which leverages models hosted in Amazon Bedrock. This agent implements a feedback-based correction loop using RAGAS metrics to assess response quality and provides relevancy scores to the orchestrator agent for decision-making purposes.

7. **Web Search Fallback**: When the RAG agent's responses receive low relevancy scores, the orchestrator agent initiates a web search process. It retrieves the Tavily web search API tool from the web search MCP server and performs dynamic queries to obtain supplementary or corrective information.

8. **Final Response Generation**: The final response generation occurs on GPU instances running vLLM. The reasoning model processes the aggregated information, including both knowledge base data and web search results when applicable, refining and rephrasing the content to create a coherent and accurate response for the user.

9. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Throughout this entire process, the Strands Agent SDK maintains comprehensive interaction tracking. All agent activities and communications are automatically traced, with the resulting data visualized through the Langfuse service, providing complete transparency and monitoring of the system's operations.

## Quick Start Guide

The whole solution is including two parts, Agentic AI platform and Agentic AI application, let us go through the Agentic AI platform firstly 

We provide two approaches to set up the Agentic AI platform:

### Option 1: Automated Setup with Makefile (Recommended)

For the fastest and most reliable setup, use our automated Makefile:

#### Prerequisites
- EKS cluster set up following the [AWS Solutions Guidance: Automated Provisioning of Application-Ready Amazon EKS Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/automated-provisioning-of-application-ready-amazon-eks-clusters/)
- `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
- Required CLI tools installed (`pnpm`, `pip`, etc.)
- a Hugging Face Token

#### How to create a Hugging Face Token

To access Hugging Face models, you'll need to create an access token:

1. **Sign up or log in** to [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)
2. **Navigate to Settings**: Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select "Settings"
3. **Access Tokens**: In the left sidebar, click on "Access Tokens"
4. **Create New Token**: Click "New token" button
5. **Configure Token**:
   - **Name**: Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., "EKS-ML-Inference")
   - **Type**: Select "Read" for most use cases (allows downloading models)
   - **Repositories**: Leave empty to access all public repositories, or specify particular ones
6. **Generate Token**: Click "Generate a token"
7. **Copy and Store**: Copy the generated token immediately and store it securely

**Important Notes**:
- Keep your token secure and never share it publicly
- You can revoke tokens at any time from the same settings page

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step Setup

If you prefer manual control or need to customize the installation:

#### Step 1: Set Up EKS Cluster

Set up your EKS cluster using the AWS Solutions Guidance for automated provisioning:

**Follow the [AWS Solutions Guidance: Automated Provisioning of Application-Ready Amazon EKS Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/automated-provisioning-of-application-ready-amazon-eks-clusters/)**

This guidance provides:
- Automated EKS cluster provisioning with best practices
- Pre-configured add-ons and operators
- Security and networking configurations
- Monitoring and observability setup

After completing the guidance, ensure your `kubectl` is configured to access the cluster:

```bash
# Verify cluster access
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

#### Step 2: Install Base Infrastructure Components

Navigate to the base setup directory and run the installation script:

```bash
cd base_eks_setup
chmod +x install_operators.sh
./install_operators.sh
```

This script installs:
- KubeRay Operator for distributed model serving
- NVIDIA GPU Operator for GPU workloads
- GP3 storage class for optimized storage
- All Karpenter node pools for different workload types

#### Step 3: Deploy Model Hosting Services

Set up the model hosting infrastructure:

```bash
cd model-hosting
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This deploys:
- Ray service with LlamaCPP and embedding capabilities
- Standalone vLLM reasoning service
- Standalone vLLM vision service
- All necessary Kubernetes resources and configurations

#### Step 4: Set Up Observability

**Important**: After deployment, configure Langfuse:
1. Access Langfuse web interface
2. Create an organization named "test"
3. Create a project inside it named "demo"
4. Go to "Tracing" menu and set up tracing
5. Record the Public Key (PK) and Secret Key (SK) - you'll need these for the agentic applications


#### Step 5: Deploy Model Gateway

Set up the unified API gateway:

```bash
cd model-gateway
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This deploys:
- LiteLLM proxy deployment
- Load balancer and ingress configuration
- Waits for services to be ready before proceeding

**Important**: After deployment, configure LiteLLM:
1. Access the LiteLLM web interface
2. Login with username "admin" and password "sk-123456"
3. Go to "Virtual Keys" on the sidebar and create a new key
4. Mark "All Team Models" for the models field
5. Store the generated secret key - you'll need it for the agentic applications

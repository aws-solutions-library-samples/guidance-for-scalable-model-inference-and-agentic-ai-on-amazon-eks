_Figure2. Reference Architecture Gen AI applications deployed on the EKS cluster_

The architecture diagrams illustrate our scalable ML inference solution with the following components:

1. **Amazon EKS Cluster**: The foundation of our architecture, providing a managed Kubernetes environment with automated provisioning and configuration.
   
2. **Karpenter Auto-scaling**: Dynamically provisions and scales compute resources based on workload demands across multiple node pools.
   
3. **Node Pools**:
   - **Graviton-based nodes (ARM64)**: Cost-effective CPU inference using m8g/c8g instances
   - **GPU-based nodes (x86_64)**: High-performance inference using NVIDIA GPU instances (g5, g6 families)
   - **x86-based nodes**: General purpose compute for compatibility requirements
   
4. **Model Hosting Services**:
   - **Ray Serve**: Distributed model serving with automatic scaling
   - **Standalone Services**: Direct model deployment for specific use cases
   - **Multi-modal Support**: Text, vision, and reasoning model capabilities
   
5. **Model Gateway**: 
   - **LiteLLM Proxy**: Unified OpenAI-compatible API gateway with load balancing and routing
   - **Ingress Controller**: External access management with SSL termination
   
6. **Agentic AI Applications**:
   - **RAG with OpenSearch**: Intelligent document retrieval and question answering
   - **Intelligent Document Processing (IDP)**: Automated document analysis and extraction
   - **Multi-Agent Systems**: Coordinated AI workflows with specialized agents
   
7. **Observability & Monitoring**: 
   - **Langfuse**: LLM observability and performance tracking
   - **Prometheus & Grafana**: Infrastructure monitoring and alerting

This architecture provides flexibility to choose between cost-optimized CPU inference on Graviton processors or high-throughput GPU inference based on your specific requirements, all while maintaining elastic scalability through Kubernetes and Karpenter.

## Architecture Steps

1. **Foundation Setup**: The foundation begins with an Amazon EKS cluster, configured for application readiness and with compute plane managed by Karpenter. This setup efficiently provisions both AWS Graviton and GPU based instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensuring robust infrastructure distribution and high availability of various Kubernetes services.

2. **User Request Entry**: User interaction starts through HTTP requests directed to an exposed endpoint, managed by Elastic Load Balancing (ELB). This entry point serves as the gateway for all user queries and ensures balanced distribution of incoming traffic while maintaining consistent accessibility.

3. **Orchestration and Analysis**: The orchestrator agent, powered by Strands Agent SDK, serves as the central coordination hub. It processes incoming queries by connecting with reasoning models supported by LiteLLM and vLLM services, analyzing the requests, and determining the appropriate workflow and tools needed for response generation. LiteLLM functions as a unified API gateway for model management, providing centralized security controls and standardized access to both embedding and reasoning models.

4. **Knowledge Validation**: Knowledge validation begins as the orchestrator agent delegates to the RAG agent to verify knowledge base currency. When updates are needed, the RAG agent initiates the process of embedding new information into the Amazon Opensearch cluster, ensuring the knowledge base remains current and comprehensive.

5. **Embedding Process**: The embedding process is handled within a KubeRay cluster, where the Ray header dynamically manages worker node scaling based on resource demands. These worker nodes execute the embedding process through the llamacpp framework, while the RAG agent simultaneously embeds user questions and searches for relevant information within the OpenSearch cluster.

6. **Quality Assurance**: Quality assurance is performed by the Evaluation Agent, which leverages models hosted in Amazon Bedrock. This agent implements a feedback-based correction loop using RAGAS metrics to assess response quality and provides relevancy scores to the orchestrator agent for decision-making purposes.

7. **Web Search Fallback**: When the RAG agent's responses receive low relevancy scores, the orchestrator agent initiates a web search process. It retrieves the Tavily web search API tool from the web search MCP server and performs dynamic queries to obtain supplementary or corrective information.

8. **Final Response Generation**: The final response generation occurs on GPU instances running vLLM. The reasoning model processes the aggregated information, including both knowledge base data and web search results when applicable, refining and rephrasing the content to create a coherent and accurate response for the user.

9. **Comprehensive Tracking**: Throughout this entire process, the Strands Agent SDK maintains comprehensive interaction tracking. All agent activities and communications are automatically traced, with the resulting data visualized through the Langfuse service, providing complete transparency and monitoring of the system's operations.

## Security

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. 
This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, 
and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. 
For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](http://aws.amazon.com/security/).

This guidance implements several security best practices and AWS services to enhance the security posture of your EKS Workload Ready Cluster. Here are the key security components and considerations:

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)

- **IAM Roles**: The architecture uses predefined IAM roles (Cluster Admin, Admin, Edit, Read) to manage access to the EKS cluster resources. 
This follows the principle of least privilege, ensuring users and services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
- **EKS Managed Node Groups**: These use IAM roles with specific permissions required for nodes to join the cluster and for pods to access AWS services.

### Network Security

- **Amazon VPC**: The EKS cluster is deployed within a custom VPC with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones, providing network isolation.
- **Security Groups**: Although not explicitly shown in the diagram, security groups are typically used to control inbound and outbound traffic to EC2 instances and other resources within the VPC.
- **NAT Gateways**: Deployed in public subnets to allow outbound internet access for resources in private subnets while preventing inbound access from the internet.

### Data Protection

- **Amazon EBS Encryption**: EBS volumes used by EC2 instances are typically encrypted to protect data at rest.
- **AWS Key Management Service (KMS)**: Used for managing encryption keys for various services, including EBS volume encryption.

### Kubernetes-specific Security

- **Kubernetes RBAC**: Role-Based Access Control is implemented within the EKS cluster to manage fine-grained access to Kubernetes resources.
- **AWS Certificate Manager**: Integrated to manage SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication within the cluster.

### Monitoring and Logging

- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Used for monitoring and logging of AWS resources and applications running on the EKS cluster.
- **Amazon Managed Grafana and Prometheus**: Provide additional monitoring and observability capabilities, helping to detect and respond to security events.

### Container Security

- **Amazon ECR**: Stores container images in a secure, encrypted repository. It includes vulnerability scanning to identify security issues in your container images.

### Secrets Management

- **AWS Secrets Manager**: While not explicitly shown in the diagram, it's commonly used to securely store and manage sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and other secrets used by applications running on EKS.

### Additional Security Considerations

- Regularly update and patch EKS clusters, worker nodes, and workload container images.
- Implement network policies to control pod-to-pod communication within the cluster.
- Use Pod Security Policies or Pod Security Standards to enforce security best practices for pods.
- Implement proper logging and auditing mechanisms for both AWS and Kubernetes resources.
- Regularly review and rotate IAM and Kubernetes RBAC permissions.

```

### Option 2: Manual Step-by-Step Setup

If you prefer manual control or need to customize the installation:

#### Step 1: Set Up EKS Cluster

Set up your EKS cluster using the AWS Solutions Guidance for automated provisioning:

**Follow the [AWS Solutions Guidance: Automated Provisioning of Application-Ready Amazon EKS Clusters](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/automated-provisioning-of-application-ready-amazon-eks-clusters/)**

This guidance provides:
- Automated EKS cluster provisioning with best practices
- Pre-configured add-ons and operators
- Security and networking configurations
- Monitoring and observability setup

After completing the guidance, ensure your `kubectl` is configured to access the cluster:

```bash
# Verify cluster access
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

#### Step 2: Install Base Infrastructure Components

Navigate to the base setup directory and run the installation script:

```bash
cd base_eks_setup
chmod +x install_operators.sh
./install_operators.sh
```

This script installs:
- KubeRay Operator for distributed model serving
- NVIDIA GPU Operator for GPU workloads
- GP3 storage class for optimized storage
- All Karpenter node pools for different workload types

#### Step 3: Deploy Model Hosting Services

Set up the model hosting infrastructure:

```bash
cd model-hosting
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This deploys:
- Ray service with LlamaCPP and embedding capabilities
- Standalone vLLM reasoning service
- Standalone vLLM vision service
- All necessary Kubernetes resources and configurations

#### Step 4: Set Up Observability

Deploy monitoring and observability tools:

```bash
cd model-observability
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This installs:
- Langfuse for LLM observability
- Web ingress for external access
- Service monitoring and logging

**Important**: After deployment, configure Langfuse:
1. Access Langfuse web interface
2. Create an organization named "test"
3. Create a project inside it named "demo"
4. Go to "Tracing" menu and set up tracing
5. Record the Public Key (PK) and Secret Key (SK) - you'll need these for the agentic applications

#### Step 5: Deploy Model Gateway

Set up the unified API gateway:

```bash
cd model-gateway
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

This deploys:
- LiteLLM proxy deployment
- Load balancer and ingress configuration
- Waits for services to be ready before proceeding

**Important**: After deployment, configure LiteLLM:
1. Access the LiteLLM web interface
2. Login with username "admin" and password "sk-123456"
3. Go to "Virtual Keys" on the sidebar and create a new key
4. Mark "All Team Models" for the models field
5. Store the generated secret key - you'll need it for the agentic applications

Right now, let us go through the deployment of an Agentic RAG application based on the Agentic AI platform

### Deploy Agentic Applications

#### Multi-Agent RAG with Strands SDK and OpenSearch

This project implements a sophisticated multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) system using the **Strands SDK** that combines Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool usage and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for enhanced context awareness, using OpenSearch as the vector database.

#### 🧠 Agent Workflows

##### Knowledge Management Workflow
1. **File Monitoring**: Scans knowledge directory for changes
2. **Change Detection**: Uses file hashes and timestamps
3. **Document Processing**: Handles multiple file formats
4. **Embedding Generation**: Creates vector embeddings
5. **Vector Storage**: Stores in OpenSearch with metadata

##### RAG Retrieval Workflow  
1. **Query Processing**: Analyzes user queries
2. **Embedding Generation**: Converts queries to vectors
3. **Similarity Search**: Finds relevant documents in OpenSearch
4. **Context Formatting**: Structures results for LLM consumption
5. **Relevance Ranking**: Orders results by similarity scores

##### MCP Tool Execution Workflow
1. **Tool Discovery**: Connects to available MCP servers
2. **Context Integration**: Combines RAG context with user queries
3. **Tool Selection**: Chooses appropriate tools for tasks
4. **Execution Management**: Handles tool calls and responses
5. **Result Processing**: Formats and returns final outputs

#### 🔧 Extending the System

##### Adding New Agents

```python
from strands import Agent, tool
from src.utils.strands_langfuse_integration import create_traced_agent

# Define tools for the agent
@tool
def my_custom_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Custom tool implementation."""
    return f"Processed: {param}"

# Create the agent with built-in tracing
my_agent = create_traced_agent(
    Agent,
    model="us.anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0",
    tools=[my_custom_tool],
    system_prompt="Your specialized prompt here",
    session_id="my-agent-session",
    user_id="system"
)
```

##### Adding New MCP Servers

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Custom Server")

@mcp.tool(description="Custom tool description")
def my_custom_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Custom tool implementation."""
    return f"Processed: {param}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="streamable-http", port=8002)
```

#### 📊 Monitoring and Observability

The system includes comprehensive observability features:

- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Native tracing through Strands SDK
- **Multiple Export Options**: Console, OTLP endpoints, Jaeger, Langfuse
- **Workflow Summaries**: Detailed execution reports
- **Performance Metrics**: Duration and success tracking
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error reporting and recovery

#### 🧪 Example Use Cases

##### Medical Knowledge Query
```python
query = "What are the symptoms and treatment options for Bell's palsy?"
result = supervisor_agent(query)
print(result['response'])
```

##### Document Analysis and Report Generation
```python
query = "Analyze the medical documents and create a summary report saved to a file"
result = supervisor_agent(query)
# System will retrieve relevant docs, analyze them, and save results using MCP tools
```
-->

## Important Notes

### 🔍 Architecture Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Each agent has specific responsibilities
2. **Scalability**: Agents can be scaled independently  
3. **Reliability**: Isolated failures don't affect the entire system
4. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new capabilities
5. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing via Strands SDK
6. **Standards Compliance**: Uses MCP for tool integration and OpenTelemetry for tracing

### 🔧 Key Improvements
